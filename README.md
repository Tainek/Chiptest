Clean Architecture, MVVM, Compose
Darkmode Compatible
Localization Friendly


For some UI/UX flair, instead of effort to decorate the lists I have Included an onboarding tutorial. I felt this added more opportunity to demonstrate clean architecture/state management.


My hypothetical next steps to improve:
Add Retry Handling
Improve Error Handling
Inject DogRepo
Refactor Navigaton
Junit Tests
